   			<p>I am nowhere near the best, but I try my best to practice and constantly learn more. Though these tips are based on how I do particular things, remember that everthing is based on your own art style. There are no right or wrong ways, these are guides at most. What matters is you're having fun and are satisfied with your work!</p>

      <h4>Posing Bodies </h4>
      <img src="../images/bodyshape.png">
      <p class="phelp">I cry because I am still not the best at doing complicated body poses BUT there are a few things I picked up. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ Everything should be thought of in a series of shapes. Circles, triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, use them all!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ Try to learn the anatomy of the human body in some form. I made sure to learn the muscle groups because I tend to draw a lot of shirtless characters. The knowledge is not really needed if you are drawing a fully clothed character but in case you want to draw a shirtless character it is nice (necessary) to know. I will do a more in-depth tutorial on drawing muscles later.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ I cannot stress this enough but REFERENCE REFERENCE REFERENCE. You cannot draw something if you’re not 100% sure what it should look like. Study the bodies of real life people and try to make connections!</p>

      <h4>Drawing Eyes (stylized)</h4>
      <img src="../images/eyetut.jpg">
      <p class="phelp">When drawing eyes, while it does help to learn the actual anatomy of them first, it also helps to think of the structure in simple shapes. I like to use a parallelogram and then get a general shape from that.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  Things to remember:
                        <br>
                  ~ You do not have to use only parallelograms. The same process can be used with other shapes like circles and even triangles. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ Lashes tend to clump together, but make sure to break them up with singular ones too.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ I like to erase tiny lines into the top part of the lash line, place hearts in my irises and I also like blurred irises. These are all purely stylistic decisions that I make based on my art style and you don’t have to follow them. Do what feels right for you!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                  ~ Extra tip: The sclera, the whites of your eyes, are not purely white. It will look completely off if you use white so instead use an off colored white (or a very very light beige), or even white with a slight blue tint.</p>

      <h4>Color Theory</h4>

      <img src="../images/colorpick2.jpg">
      <p class="phelp">~ Complimentary colors are colors that sit directly opposite each other on the color wheel. For example the complimentary color for blue is orange. Complimentary colors are good for contrast and to create eye-catching color schemes. One setback is that the combo of complimentary colors can quickly go from pleasing to too much.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                        ~ Triadic colors are three colors spaced equally apart on the color wheel and this tends to form a triangle. The colors that the three points of the triangle point to are your triadic colors. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                        ~ Analogous colors are neighboring, or adjacent, colors on the wheel.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                        ~ Monotone color schemes mostly contain ONE hue but different shades of that hue are used. These are usually accompanied with one accent and one contrast color so it is not too monotone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ~Reminder: colors can be both relative and absolute. Absolute is the color as it is but when color theory is applied correctly your colors become relative. Relative colors are kind of up to interpretation, they look different according to the perception of your eye.

      <h4>Flip Your Canvas!</h4>
        <img src="../images/flipcanvas.png">
        <p class="phelp">
        	Looking at a drawing and something is bugging you but you do not know what?....flip your canvas!
				<br>
				<br>
			A lot of us tend to draw lines that lean a certain way depending on your dominant hand. For example, I am right-handed so my drawings tend to lean heavily to the left and the same would happen vice versa with a left-handed person. 
				<br>
				<br>
			You can flip your canvas in Procreate by clicking on the wrench tool icon and going to the canvas drop down. From there you should see it say “flip canvas horizontally.”
